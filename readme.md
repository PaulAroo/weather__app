# [☁️Weather App☁️](https://thrills-weather-app.vercel.app/)

A web application that allows users to get weather data for a location of their choice.
Data is being fetched from [OpenWeather API](https://openweathermap.org/current)

- Live Site URL: [Preview](https://thrills-weather-app.vercel.app/)

### Built with

- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Tailwind Css](https://tailwindcss.com/) - For styles
- [Framer Motion](https://www.framer.com/motion/) - For animations
- [Parcel](https://parceljs.org/) - For bundling

### What I learned

- how to use the fetch API to make GET requests
- Error handling
- user input validation

### Continued development

- [ ] Animate card for an input that already exists when a user tries to search --in a bid to get the user's attention--
- [ ] Add feature -- a button maybe? -- that allows users to auomatically generate weather data for their current location
